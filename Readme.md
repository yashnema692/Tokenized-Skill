## Project Title
Tokenized Skill Tree Progression

## Project Description
This project creates a **Tokenized Skill Tree** where users can unlock skills by spending a custom ERC-20 token. The goal is to create a progression system where users earn tokens by achieving milestones, then spend those tokens to unlock new skills within a skill tree. The system is decentralized, and users can track their progress in the tree. Each skill is associated with a specific token cost, and users can unlock new skills once they have earned enough tokens.

## Project Vision
The vision for this project is to create an interactive, tokenized skill progression system on the blockchain. The goal is to gamify skill progression using tokens that users can earn, spend, and trade. The decentralized nature of the project ensures that the progression system is transparent and cannot be altered by a centralized authority. This project could be extended to educational systems, gaming, or any platform where skills are acquired and tracked.

Future enhancements could include:
- **Dynamic Skill Trees**: Create skill trees with more complex structures, where certain skills unlock only after others are completed.
- **Achievement Badges**: Introduce additional rewards for users who unlock a series of skills.
- **Staking and Rewards**: Allow users to stake their tokens to earn additional rewards.

## Key Features
- **ERC-20 Token (SkillToken)**: Users can earn and use the custom ERC-20 token to unlock skills.
- **Unlockable Skills**: Users can unlock skills by spending the required number of tokens.
- **User Progress Tracking**: The system tracks how many skills a user has unlocked.
- **Skill Tree System**: The skill tree is structured as a list of skills that can be added or removed by the contract owner.
- **Owner-Controlled Skill Management**: Only the owner can add new skills to the skill tree, ensuring control over progression logic.
- **Decentralized**: Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the contract is immutable and transparent, ensuring fairness in the progression system.
